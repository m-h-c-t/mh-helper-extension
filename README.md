# MouseHunt-Helper-Extension

This is the a Browser Extension (Chrome/FF/Opera). It helps collect hunt info for popular game called MouseHunt. The collected info (like trap, cheese, charm, base, mouse, location) will be used in the future. The goal is to create a crowd sourced data for a catch rate and attraction rate calculator website. Which in turn help people with the game.

 - Collects info like hunts (catches, misses, traps, bases, cheese, etc), crowns, convertibles (chests, curds, etc), maps and more.
 - Only submits game information and related ids, mice, cheese, etc. (no player names, or anything like that)
 - Does not collect info on friend horns or trap checks.
 - Only reads and collects data, does not change anything in the game.

Special thanks to all who helped. Few honorable mentions: Tehhowch, Aardwolf, Tsitu's tools team, Loaf, Groupsky, Nick (HornTracker), and many others who helped with advice, ideas, and otherwise. Also thanks to contributors and discord mods.

This tool uses some of the [Tsitu's scripts](https://github.com/tsitu/MH-Tools/) to autopopulate their site from extension.
